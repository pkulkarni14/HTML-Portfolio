    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <hr />
    <li><b>Sensor Data Visualization Platform:</b> Implemented an interactive website to display Sensor data and
        SensorType data
        from a Mango database, resulting in a user-friendly interface for users to do CRUD operations. Tech: React,
        Typescript,
        MongoDB, JSON, Git. (Dec ’23)</li>
    <li><b>Car Rental System - Database Management System:</b> Led the creation of a schema and database model for a Car
        Rental system while spearheading the development of SQL CRUD operations. Utilized SQL joins and Triggers for
        advanced
        database querying. Tech: JAVA, SQL, Database Schema Design, SQL Joins ( July ’22)</li>
    <li><b>OPENCV Based Smart Attendance System Using Facial Recognition:</b> Face recognition systems can utilize
        facial
        landmarks or facial nodal points. OpenCV and Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH) can be applied to automate
        attendance marking and store attendance data in CSV format. Tech: OpenCV, BackEnd, Python (March ’21)</li>
    <h2>Publications</h2>
    <hr />
    <li><b>Performance Assessment of Hetero-Junction Intrinsic Thin Film HIT Photovoltaic (Machine Learning,
            Random Forest Regression):</b> Developed a model to forecast HIT Module temperature, considering sudden
        environmental
        changes. The model incorporates factors such as irradiance, temperature, and module efficiency parameters, and
        utilizes the
        Random Forest Regression algorithm for training and prediction. Additionally, integrated the OpenCV library and
        Keras API
        to expedite model training.. Tech: Python (June ’22) <a href="https://www.itm-conferences.org/articles/itmconf/abs/2022/04/itmconf_icacc2022_01009/itmconf_icacc2022_01009.html">(Research Paper)</a></li>
